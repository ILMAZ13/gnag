This allows you to integrate checkstyle, findbugs, and PMD with minimal effort. It is important to leave the report output paths as default and disable the `abortOnError` flag to allow gnag to finish collecting all reports.\r\n\r\nAdd the following to the build script of your project\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        maven {\r\n            jcenter()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath 'com.btkelly:gnag:{current version}'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'gnag-plugin'\r\n\r\ngnag {\r\n    gitHubRepoName 'user/repo'\r\n    gitHubAuthToken \"12312n3j12n3jk1\"\r\n    gitHubIssueNumber \"11\"\r\n    failBuildOnError true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest way to add automatic PR checking and commenting to your project. The options defined in the gnag closure can be overridden by passing command line parameters with the same name to your build. This is helpful when using in conjunction with a CI system to allow automated builds.\r\n\r\n### Example Output\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the output posted to a GitHub pr on a project using gnag to enforce quality checks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/826036/11042826/641378e2-86e7-11e5-90ff-555a7cafd78c.png\" />\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by Bryan Kelly (@btkelly) in collaboration with Stuart Kent (@stkent)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the library?
